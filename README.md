mining-microarray
=================

This is project work for Data Mining class, part of my Master's degree.

## Overview
Mining Microarray data - correlation analysis and, neighborhood based interestingness analysis of emerging patterns.

The given data is discretized using entropy-based discretization and FP-growth algorithm is used to mine minimal genesets correlated with a class. Emerging patterns are mined for each class and, interestingness analysis is done based on total distance of a pattern.

### Project Specifications
Refer to project2.pdf

### Procedure, assumptions and findings
Refer to report.pdf
(I have worked on tasks 1 and 3)

### Input file - colon cancer data
Sample input file is available at cc.data

### Execution
Refer to READ ME.txt

#### Note
I am not an expert in Java so, some of the code may be redundant.
