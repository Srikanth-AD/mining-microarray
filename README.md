mining-microarray
=================

This is project work for Data Mining class, part of my Master's degree.

Overview:
Mining Microarray data - performs entropy discretization and uses FP-growth algorithm to mine minimal genesets correlated with a class. Emerging patterns are mined for each class and interestingness analysis is done based on total distance of a pattern.
